# Syndicate: A comprehensive coding portfolio

## Getting Started

> We use `yarn` as our package manager. So, make sure you have installed `yarn` as a prerequisite.

Follow these steps in order to start working on the project

- Fork your own copy of the project.
- Work on the assigned module.
- Send a pull request after you have achieved a milestone.
- Make sure you have gone through and follow `CodingStandards.md`.

In order to install the dependencies, use `yarn install` both in the root directory and the webapp subdirectory. It will automatically detect and install the necessary dependencies.

To run a hot-reloadable version of the website, use `yarn start` command. This will automatically host the website at `http://localhost:3000`. You can navigate to your module by using the subdirectories as follows

- Chatroom: `/chartoom`
- IDE: `/ide`
- Profile: `/profile`
